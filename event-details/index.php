                                    This novice race is designed for the first time triathlete, those new to the sport, our Junior Triathletes.
                                    The swim is a shorter, more manageable 1/4 mile distance, (instead of the standard 1/2-mile Sprint distance swim),
                                    10 mile bike ride (vs 12 miles and it's a 2 loop course making it very spectator friendly!) and a flat 2 mile run (vs 3 mile sprint course).

                                    Half-Marathon event starts and finishes in the Athletes Village to the cheers of the enthusiastic crowd.

                                    The 10K event starts and finishes in the Athletes Village. The paths are approximately 6 ft wide, perfectly paved and wind around through the forest.
                                    Each course has only two small hills with a minimal elevation gain to navigate and a fast downhill to flat finish to the roaring cheers of the crowd.

                                <h3>What to Bring</h3>
                                <p>Watch the weather closely. The show goes on no matter what the weather is doing.</p>

                                   <p>
                                       You must wear your chip timing piece during the entire event.  You will be given a band that will hold your chip timing piece around your ankle throughout the entire event.
                                    Be sure that it is snapped tightly. Be sure to have your Chip Timing piece on before you start the race and be sure to step over the timing mats after each segment of the race.
                                    If you are wearing a wet-suit, make sure the timing piece goes under your wetsuit otherwise, you will have a very difficult time getting off your wet suit.
                                   </p>
                                <h3>Swim</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Wetsuits are optional for the swim but will provide buoyancy and warmth. However, many people opt for no wetsuit for a triathlon so no worries.
                                        We will provide you with a swim cap but you will want to bring your own goggles.
                                    </p>

                                <p>
                                    The Splash-N-Dash is an event for kids ages 4 to 15. It is a 100 yard swim and a 50 yard dash.
                                    It is free for kids who have an adult registered for an event and $25 for those who don't.
                                </p>
