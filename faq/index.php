                                    <p>We currently adhere to the USAT Rules for Triathlon & Duathlon.
                                        Important rules include no drafting, you must wear a helmet and music is
                                        ABSOLUTELY NOT allowed during the bike for obvious safety reasons.
                                    </p>
                                </dd>

                                <dt>Can I use a personal music device while cycling?</dt>
                                <dd>
                                    <p> Absolutely no music devices are allowed during the bike segment for
                                       obvious safety risks and will result in immediate disqualification.
                                    </p>
                                </dd>

                                <dt>Can I use a personal music device while running?</dt>
                                <dd>
                                    <p> During any running segments, we prefer for athletes to NOT use music devices
                                        to maximize safety, assure a fair competitive environment and assure athletes
                                        can hear all course marshal instructions. With that said, we also understand that
                                        many athletes rely on music to help endure the challenge of running. To accommodate
                                        the needs of our athletes while still assuring maximum safety and a fair, competitive environment,
                                        here is the arrangement that we can accommodate.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If you chose to use a personal music device, you must always keep one ear open for instructions
                                        so only one ear-bud can be used at any time. In addition, if you opt to use music, you will not
                                        be eligible for awards, points and rankings.
                                        So as an athlete, you have to make a choice of music or awards/points/rankings.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If you are using a personal music devise with two earbuds, you will be immediately disqualified. Trust us, we don't want
                                        to have to enforce a disqualification but in order to assure the safety of all athletes, this is a very important rule.
                                    </p>

                                <dt>Do I need to wear a wetsuit?</dt>
                                <dd>
                                    <p>
                                        No, you do not need to wear a wetsuit. Many will not wear a wetsuit while others will
                                        choose to wear a wetsuit because of the buoyancy and warmth factor.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        No. We welcome any type of bike as long as it is functioning properly with brakes and
                                        endcaps at the end of your handlebars.
